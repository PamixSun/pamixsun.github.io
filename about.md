My name is Xu Sun. I'm a Chinese student studing in Guangzhou, whose main interests are machine learning, data analysis and efficient algorithms. 
I also spend a fair amount of time programming for fun, and the languages that I have ever used include C, C++, Java, Python and Matlab etc.

You can also find me on a variety of other places across the t'interwebs:

* [Weibo][weibo] - A website like twitter, popular in China.
* [CSDN][csdn] - A popular website for programmers in China.
* [GitHub][github] - A wonderful website which could help you to build your software better.
