## AI Demo

The model is specialized in analyzing retinal fundus images, and is trained exclusively on fundus image datasets to classify images as glaucoma or non-glaucoma. Therefore, to obtain accurate predictions, it is crucial to only input fundus images when using this model. Feeding other types of images may lead to meaningless results. In summary, this model expects fundus images as input for glaucoma classification. For the best performance, please adhere strictly to this input specification.
